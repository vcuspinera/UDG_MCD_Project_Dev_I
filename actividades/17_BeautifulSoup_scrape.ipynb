Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, was in Michigan while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made multiple stops in Wisconsin, another crucial swing state.Earlier in the day, a Pennsylvania judge ruled Elon Musk's $1M giveaway can continue and the National Guard in Washington D.C. was activated to assist local authorities this week.Guard members in other states were on standby.\n",

      "Fisher pointed to the lack of improvement in black communities such as failing urban school districts and challenges with crime and poverty as to why black voters should not support Democrats in the election.\"For so long, we've just been blindly loyal to the Democrat Party — the Democratic Party — for no reason,\" Fisher said. \"They have given us no reason to have such loyalty — to maintain such loyalty — to them.\"He first expressed support for Trump in November 2023, saying on \"Fox & Friends\" at the time that \"the Democratic Party is not for us.\"\"They don’t really understand because they don’t educate themselves on Donald Trump as a person and his history,\" Fisher said.The national Black Lives Matter organization and Black Lives Matter Rhode Island PAC have publicly distanced themselves from Fisher and his endorsement of Trump, calling his support for the former president \"a publicity stunt.\"\n",
      "\"The right-wing continues to use and amplify fringe Black voices to create an idea of broad support for their corrupt candidates,\" the two groups said in a joint statement to CNN last year.Black Lives Matter Rhode Island PAC also released a separate statement in which they said Fisher \"is not and has never been affiliated with our organization.\"Posted by Landon Mion ShareHarris again doesn't mention Trump by name in battleground rallyUS Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris walks on stage as she arrives for a campaign rally at the Carrie Blast Furnaces National Historic Landmark outside Pittsburgh, in Rankin, Pennsylvania on November 4, 2024. (Photo by Rebecca DROKE / AFP) (Photo by REBECCA DROKE/AFP via Getty Images)Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the Pittsburgh area on Monday evening where she rallied support in the battleground state, while again steering clear from naming her political opponent in her remarks.\"Tomorrow is election day. And the momentum is on our side. Our campaign has tapped into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States,\" Harris said from the rally in Rankin, which is about eight miles from Pittsburgh.\"We still got some work to do because, look, the race is not over, and we must finish strong,\" she continued.\n",
      "Harris again did not name former President Donald Trump during her remarks, which is a departure from her typical stump speeches as of Sunday. Harris did not name Trump during her four campaign stops across Michigan on Sunday, nor did she name him during her events in Scranton or Allentown earlier Monday.Harris rallied in Pittsburgh late Monday, where she was joined by celebrities such as Katy Perry, who performed during the rally, and actor Cedric the Entertainer.\"I will listen to people who disagree with me because I do not believe that people who disagree with me are the enemy. In fact, I will give them a seat at the table. That is what real leaders do. That is what strong leaders do.

      "\"Your paychecks will be higher. Your streets will be safer and cleaner. Your communities will be richer, and your future will be brighter than ever before,\" Trump said Monday evening from Pittsburgh. \"​​This will be the golden age of America,\" he said to applause and cheers from the crowds. Trump’s final day on the campaign trail included rallies and stops in North Carolina and Pennsylvania before heading to Grand Rapids, Michigan, later Monday for his final rally before Election Day. While in Pittsburgh, he was joined by Roberto Clemente Jr., a former baseball player and son of the Pittsburgh Pirates legend. \"I'm very proud to be here. For the first time, I had to take a step forward. And it is very important for me to support this man, because I believe tomorrow is a change of time. … The name Clemente, what it means is goodwill and unity. I believe that your team is going to bring it all home,\" Clemente Jr. told the crowds. \n",
      "\"I believe in everything that you stand for right now, being able to make the change for our families. My three kids that are very young, and we live here in Pennsylvania. And I told this man that I commit myself to helping RFK JR. with … our kids and making America healthy again,\" he continued. Trump took the stage at Pittsburgh's PPG Paints Arena just after 7:30 p.m., where he revealed more than an hour into the rally that he had just heard Joe Rogan officially endorsed him for president. \"It just came over the wires that Joe Rogan just endorsed me,\" Trump said, following Megyn Kelly joining him on stage where she rallied support for the Trump-Vance ticket. This is an excerpt from an article by Emma Colton.Posted by Louis Casiano Sharewindow.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){\n",

      "Those in favor of the proposition say it is necessary to protect abortion rights in the state. However, opponents say it has nothing to do with abortion, which they say is already protected by New York law.\"It's being portrayed as necessary to protect abortion rights, but that's false,\" John Faso, an attorney and former New York state representative, told Fox News Digital. \"Abortion was legalized in New York State by the legislature in 1970, 54 years ago. And it's not under any threat whatsoever, regardless of what your position is on it.\"Abortion is currently legal in New York through 24 weeks of pregnancy\n",
      ". After 24 weeks, a woman can still obtain an abortion if her medical provider decides the unborn baby is not viable or the woman’s life or physical or mental health is at risk.According to information on the website for New York Attorney General Letitia James, \"people of all ages have the absolute right to abortion\" in New York.Faso said that \"to argue that somehow abortion rights are at risk in New York State is just a complete lie.\"\"If passed, the proposition would amend the state constitution to prohibit any discrimination based on ethnicity, national origin, age, disability and sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health care and autonomy.\"This is an excerpt from an article by Peter Pinedo.Posted by Louis Casiano ShareJournalist Mark Halperin says early voting numbers bad for Dems; ‘They’re really worried’People mark their ballots at the polling place at Tysons-Pimmit Regional Library in Falls Church, Va., Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024.

      "Journalist Mark Halperin on Monday said that early voting is a worrying indicator for Vice President Kamala Harris, as Republicans have reportedly made gains compared to 2020.“My sense of the early vote is it is not as disastrous as it was in the first three days to the Democrats, but it’s still really bad,\" Halperin said on “The Morning Meeting with Mark Halperin, Sean Spicer & Dan Turrentine.\" And the Harris campaign has done a great job of spinning the national media on it. And when you talk to people in the states, there’s two categories of people in the states.\"\n",
      "“There’s more junior people who don’t lie about the data and what it means,\" he added. \"What you have now is tons of senior Democrats are in the states, they’re door-knocking, like people who have run presidential campaigns are literally going to Michigan and Pennsylvania and door-knocking.”On Sunday, former President Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina said on “Inside with Jen Psaki” that early voting numbers “are a little scary.”His remarks are “the biggest indication that we’ve seen that the early vote is a problem for her [Harris],” Halperin said, noting that Messina has been optimistic about Harris during television interviews.Posted by Louis Casiano Sharewindow.foxstrike.cmd.push(function(Strike){\n",

      "Cardi B – the rapper who has pumped out some great songs, like WAP (look it up, it's a talker!) – is firing back at all the internet bullies who made fun of her for melting down when her teleprompter malfunctioned at a rally for Kamala Harris over the weekend. B took to Instagram Live to let all the haters know that she was nervous, her mind was RACING the whole time, and everyone who made fun of her for using a tiny little phone for the rest of the speech can piss right the hell off. Hey, internet bullies – leave Cardi B alone! Leave Cardi B alone!Absolute class here from Cardi B. The Wet A-- P---y singer handled this with grace and aplomb. Kamala Harris must be so proud. Look, I wrote about Cardi fumbling over her words last weekend, so I guess that makes me one of the bullies who prompted this little episode. To be fair, though, I did say public speaking wasn't for everyone. It's intimidating looking out into the crowd and seeing all the white dudes for Harris staring back at you. Seriously!They're intimidating dudes, surely. I'm sweating just thinking about it. But … you'd think if you realllllllly supported someone, you'd be able to speak from the heart for a few minutes while the script gets downloaded to a cell phone and handed to you on a silver platter. Right? Like, fine – maybe Cardi B isn't great at public speaking. That's fair. It's not easy. But if she was actually voting for Kamala Harris because she believed in her – as she says – and not just because the Harris campaign floated her a fat check (allegedly) to speak to her dozens of supporters, you'd think she'd be able to at least freestyle for 60 seconds on why Kamala is so great. Right?Wrong, according to Cardi!\"So you know, when it comes to this s***  right here, I let you know what I've been wanting to say, but I had to make sure I ain't forget, so I wrote that s*** the f*** down!\"\"Bitch, I be arguing on my shower.\"Fair point. Our bad, Cardi. Carry on.  \n",
